# Data_Science

A curated list of 25 projects that i have been working on since Sept 1 , 2022 on various problem statements in data science.The dataset are already available in my GitHUb gist or you can download it from each project folder itself 

## General Structure of the projects:
* Import libraries.
* Load in the dataset.
* Getting familiar with the dataset (checking for null-values, info, describe, head, etc.).
* Cleaning the dataset (Filling missing values, dropping missing values, etc.).
* Feature Engineering.
* Visualizing the data.
* Collect insights and inference from the results

The hardest part of solving a machine learning problem can be finding the right estimator for the job.different estimators are better suited for different types of data and different problems.The flowchart below is from the offcial website of sklearn and us designed to give users a bit of a rough guide on how to approach problems with regard to which estimators to try on your data.This has been of immense help to me and is always a reference for me.
