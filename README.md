# Data_Science

A curated list of 50 projects that i have been working on since Sept 1 with my friend and classmate **@Adarsh0047**, 2022 on various problem statements in data science with particular focus in topics such as  
* Data preprocessing and cleaning 
* Feature engineering and transformation 
* Feature extraction 
* Data visualization

## General Structure of the projects:
* Import libraries.
* Load in the dataset.
* Getting familiar with the dataset (checking for null-values, info, describe, head, etc.).
* Cleaning the dataset (Filling missing values, dropping missing values, etc.).
* Feature Engineering.
* Visualizing the data.
* Collect insights and inference from the results
